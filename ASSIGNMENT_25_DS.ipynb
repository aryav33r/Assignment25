        "## 1) **What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**ANSWER** :  **Square Brackets []**:\n",
        "- Creates a list comprehension that immediately evaluates and returns a list\n",
        "- Example: `[x**2 for x in range(5)]` produces `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]`\n",
        "- All elements are computed and stored in memory at once\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parentheses ()**:\n",
        "- Creates a generator expression that returns a generator object\n",
        "- Example: `(x**2 for x in range(5))` produces a generator object\n",
        "- Elements are computed lazily (on-demand) which is memory efficient\n",
        "- Doesn't store all values in memory at once\n",
        "\n",
        "Key differences:\n",
        "- Memory usage: List comprehensions use more memory for large datasets\n",
        "- Evaluation time: List comprehensions evaluate immediately, generators evaluate lazily\n",
        "- Reusability: Lists can be iterated multiple times, generators are exhausted after one use\n",
        "- Methods available: Lists have all list methods, generators have limited functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2) **What is the relationship between generators and iterators? ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**ANSWER** : **Iterators**:\n",
        "- Objects that implement the iterator protocol (`__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods)\n",
        "- Can be created from any iterable using `iter()`\n",
        "- Maintain state and produce one value at a time when `next()` is called\n",
        "- Raise `StopIteration` when no more items are available\n",
        "\n",
        "**Generators**:\n",
        "- A special kind of iterator created using generator functions or generator expressions\n",
        "- Implement the iterator protocol automatically\n",
        "- More convenient way to create iterators without explicitly defining `__iter__()` and `__next__()`\n",
        "- Maintain their local state automatically between calls\n",
        "- Can be paused and resumed using `yield`\n",
        "\n",
        "Relationship:\n",
        "- All generators are iterators, but not all iterators are generators\n",
        "- Generators provide a simpler syntax for creating iterators\n",
        "- Both produce values one at a time and maintain state\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3) **What are the signs that a function is a generator function ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**ANSWER** : A function is a generator function if:\n",
        "1. It contains at least one `yield` statement (even if unreachable)\n",
        "2. It does not contain a `return` statement with a value (can have empty `return`)\n",
        "3. When called, it returns a generator object immediately without executing the function body\n",
        "4. The function's code only executes when iterating over the generator\n",
        "\n",
        "Other indicators:\n",
        "- The function documentation may mention it's a generator\n",
        "- The function name might follow a convention like starting with \"gen_\" or ending with \"_generator\"\n",
        "- The function is typically used in a context where lazy evaluation is expected (like in a for loop or with `next()`)\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def count_up_to(n):  # Generator function\n",
        "    i = 1\n",
        "    while i <= n:\n",
        "        yield i\n",
        "        i += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4) **What is the purpose of a yield statement ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**ANSWER** : The `yield` statement:\n",
        "1. Defines a generator function when used in a function body\n",
        "2. Pauses the function execution and \"yields\" a value to the caller\n",
        "3. Remembers its state (local variables, instruction pointer) for the next call\n",
        "4. Allows the function to produce a sequence of values over time rather than computing them all at once\n",
        "\n",
        "Key characteristics:\n",
        "- When the generator function is called again (via `next()`), execution resumes immediately after the `yield`\n",
        "- Each `yield` produces one value in the sequence\n",
        "- The generator function's local variables persist between yields\n",
        "- When the function ends or executes a `return`, the generator raises `StopIteration`\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "- Memory efficiency (values are generated on demand)\n",
        "- Enables working with infinite sequences\n",
        "- Allows for pipeline processing of data\n",
        "- Simplifies state management in iterators\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5) **What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two ?**\n",
        "**ANSWER** : **Similarities**:\n",
        "- Both can transform sequences by applying a function to each element\n",
        "- Both produce iterables in Python 3 (map returns an iterator, list comprehension returns a list)\n",
        "- Both can process multiple iterables in parallel (map with multiple arguments, list comprehension with multiple for clauses)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Differences**:\n",

        "- Use `map()` when:\n",
        "  - You already have the function you want to apply\n",
        "  - You're working with other functional constructs (filter, reduce)\n",

        "\n",
        "The list comprehension is generally preferred in Python for its readability, unless you're specifically working in a functional programming style."
